The VAXstation 3100 power supplies are plagued with the usual leaky capacitor
issues.  In most cases, they are fairly easy to fix by simple cleaning the
board with isopropanol and replacing the capacitors.  One slight annoyance is
that the boards have no part designators and no polarity indication.  Hence I
took some notes.


Model H7821-00
--------------
This is the PSU in the smaller BA42-A enclosure as used for at least the
following machines:

* VAXstation 3100 M30, M38, M76
* MicroVAX/VAXserver 3100 M10, M10e, M30
* InfoServer 150
* DECstation 2100
* Storage Expansion

Here is a view of the main PCB from above, i.e., component side up:

image::h7821-00.svg["H7821-00 Capacitor Locations"]

Note that C15 and C16 are mounted to little daughter boards.  The negative
side for C15 is the one closest to the main PCB. C16 negative side is shown on the the diagram. It is opposite of the fans.

The original capacitor values are as follows:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Designator | Quantity | Description | Diameter (+/-1 mm)

| C1–C5      | 5        | 1800uF 25V 105C, low ESR | 12 mm
| C6, C11    | 2        | 330uF 25V 85C            | 10 mm
| C7–C10     | 4        | 10uF 35V 85C             | 6 mm
| C12        | 1        | 470uF 25V 85C            | 10 mm
| C13, C14   | 2        | 470uF 250WV 105C         | 30 mm
| C15        | 1        | 39uF 16V 85C             | 6 mm
| C16        | 1        | 47uF 16V 105C            | 8 mm
|===

I usually replace all of these by 105C capacitors of the same or higher
voltage, and use either 33uF or 47uF for C15.  Make sure to use low ESR parts
for C1–C5!

NOTE: In my experience, testing the PSU without a load works well enough.  The
fans come on and the voltages are about right.  However, the LED doesn't light
up until there is at least some load.

Voltages:

Please note that 9V is between pins 13 and 14.

Model H7822-00
--------------
This is the PSU in the larger BA42-B enclosure as used for at least the
following machines:

* VAXstation 3100 M40, M48
* MicroVAX/VAXserver 3100 M20, M20e, M40, M80, M85, M88, M90, M95, M96, M98
* InfoServer 100
* DECstation 3100
* DECsystem 5100

The PSU consists of two large PCBs, one of which is identical to the one from
the smaller Model H7821-00 PSU above.  Here is a view of the second PCB, again
component side up:

image::h7822-00.svg["H7822-00 Capacitor Locations",width=80%]

The original capacitor values on this board are as follows:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Designator | Quantity | Description

| C20        | 1        | 220uF 400WV 85C
| C21        | 1        | 330uF 50V 85C
| C22        | 1        | 47uF 16V 105C
| C23–C26    | 4        | 1800uF 25V 105C, low ESR

Note that for a full PSU recap you will need these parts _and_ those listed
for the Model H7821-00.

Instructions on how to disassemble the H7821 by Peter Coghlan
-------------------------------------------------------------
These instructions have been successfully tested on Model H7821-00 in 2024.

* Press the four tabs on the back of the mains switch (power button) in to enable it to push through the panel it is mounted in.  Once it is free of the panel, it is easier to prise off the four spade connectors on the back of it. They may be very tight so some leverage from a screwdriver or pliers may be needed. Remember which connector goes where for putting them back on.

* Insert a large screwdriver or similar tool behind the IEC power inlet socket (power input cable) to press its tabs in, two tabs on one side, one tab on the other, to allow the socket to be eased out from the panel it is mounted in, one side at a time. If there is one tab on the top then there will be two tabs on the bottom. Do the same for the power outlet socket (power output monitor cable) if there is one.

* Take off the spade connectors used to make the live (phase) and neutral connections to the IEC socket(s), remembering where they need to go back on. You can leave the earth connector on. Take off the outside nut on the earthing stud to release the earth wire going to the PCB. Assuming it has been assembled in the right order, you can leave on the nuts which secure the earth wires going to the IEC power socket(s), leaving the socket(s) dangling on the earth wire(s).

* Next remove the eight phillips screws holding the PCB into the frame.

* Unplug the two fan connectors from the board, remembering which is which because they are separately controlled. Also unplug the green LED from the rear daughter board, noting which way around the connector goes as it is difficult to get it back on. Initially, I thought it was necessary to unclip the green LED from the panel it is mounted in but after doing a few of these PSUs, I found I could leave it in place.

* It should now be possible to tilt and swivel the PCB out of the frame. There is a little cutout in the end of the board which allow it to get past the back of the green LED but be careful not to end up breaking the leads to it. A bit of fiddling with the cable harness might be required to extract part of it from between the frame and the fans but it should not be necessary to disengage it completely from the frame in order to get at the back of the PCB.

Warning: Do not attempt to remove the fans from the frame as the rivet-like things they are secured with cannot easily be reused and if they are replaced with nuts and bolts, the may end up vibrating loose or shorting to something on the board or both.
